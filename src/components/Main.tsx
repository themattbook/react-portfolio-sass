                    I&apos;m Matt. I&apos;m a FullStack Developer who loves
                    UI/UX. I specialize in React and Vue, TypeScript, Sass, and
                    Tailwindcss.

                    I enjoy simplistic and modern, yet minimal design. Since
                    discovering what Sass can do, I&apos;ve started migrating
                    away from Tailwindcss and into more maintainable digs.
